# DailyCode

DailyCode is a serious game prototype designed to teach computational thinking to new students in the field of Information Technology. It aims to help students understand logical thinking through events that closely relate to the player's reality.

## Motivation

The development of DailyCode was motivated by the high failure rates in introductory programming courses. A study conducted at USP between 2010 and 2014 showed that:

- 3 out of 10 students fail the introductory programming course
- In many cases, the failure rate exceeded 50%
- More than 25% of the students who passed had to take the course 2 or more times

## Objective

The main objective of DailyCode is to develop a serious game prototype that stimulates and assists in teaching computational thinking to new IT students, helping them understand logical thinking through events that relate to the player's reality.

## Game Overview

DailyCode is a Visual Novel-style game where the player takes on the role of Piter, a college student in an IT course. Piter wakes up remembering he has a programming logic test that day, for which he hasn't studied much. He decides to use computational thinking to improve his logical skills while performing his daily tasks until the exam.

### Key Features

- Interactive storytelling
- Programming logic puzzles integrated into daily activities
- Visual novel-style gameplay
- Generated images using AI tools (MidJourney, DALL-E, Fooocus)

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for game structure and mechanics)
- Electron (for desktop application packaging)

## Target Audience

The target audience for this prototype is IT students who have been in a higher education course related to this area for a maximum of 2 years, as basic knowledge of programming logic is necessary.

## Content Covered

- Conditional structures
- Repetition loops
- Queues
- Stacks

## Evaluation

The game was evaluated using the EGameFlow method, which assesses eight dimensions:

1. Concentration
2. Challenge
3. Autonomy
4. Clarity of Objectives
5. Feedback
6. Immersion
7. Social Interaction
8. Knowledge Improvement

## Results

Based on initial evaluations, DailyCode received a slightly positive feedback in all game elements, resulting in high acceptance from evaluators. The final average score was 5.51 out of 7.

## Future Work

- Implement improvements based on user feedback
- Develop new features such as different ways to answer questions (multiple choice, complete code insertion, true/false questions)
- Return the C language code of the solved problem after each question
